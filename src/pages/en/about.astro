    You will find on this website sharing of varied experiences according to my
    passions of the moment. Web, cloud, embedded development, electronics...

  <p>This website is built with Astro.</p>

  <h2>My journey</h2>

  <p>
    Passionate about countless fields, but especially IT. I have started very
    young with video games on my grandfather's knees. Until the day i wanted to
    understand how my favorite tool worked and the desire to create became more
    important to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few ugly programs and sites later, I started a school curriculum through
    C, C++ and embedded development on beaglebone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today after passing a master in France, i'm specialized in web & cloud
    development. I got my hands on many javascript tools & framworks according
    to project needs. (Angular, capacitor, Ionic, NodeJs, WebGL - Pixijs,
    Socket.io, NestJs etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    I really like R&D activities, optimizing performances, solving problems.
    Anything that requires creativity.
